        <p>
            My name is Saeed Altaf, and I was born in the UK on March 1, 1989.  Since, I have had the privelage to live in many different parts of the world, including Munich, Barcelona, Abu Dhabi, Toronto, Austin, Dallas and Atlanta.  I feel like being exposed to many different cultures helped me gain interest in a variety of different careers.
        </p>
        <p>
            During my Bachelor's Degree in Accounting and Information Management (from the University of Texas at Dallas), I undertook an international audit internship at Ernst & Young in Abu Dhabi.  Since, I have been able to gain experience in many different industries as an accountant.  Upon graduation, I worked as a staff accountant, a property accountant, a fixed asset accountant, and a construction accountant.  During these jobs, I was able to utilize the "Information Management" portion of my Bachelor's Degree in order to help optimize reporting and streamline procedures.  This was a key for me to move up the ladder to become a Senior Level Accountant.
        </p>
        <p>
            After my final Senior Accountant position at Cortland Partners, I left the corporate world.  I decided to take a leave from working and clear my mind, and re-focus my mind.  During my year off, I travelled all over Europe with my wife.  Also, during this time, I realized that I want to start a small business, and after doing research and speaking to a relative in the industry, I decided that logistics would be ideal.  However, in order for me to learn the industry, I decided I needed to start from the bottom.  So, I went out, got my Commercial Driver's License, and became a truck driver!  After one year of driving over the road, I got my TWIC card and went into transporting cars.  About one year in, I purchased my first truck, and started Grand Trunk Express!  I drove for a few months before hiring my first driver and since then, I have grown my fleet to 4 trucks and 4 drivers, all managed by a freight broker.
        </p>
        <p>
            After starting Grand Trunk Express, and having the business run profitably with minimal intervention on my part, I decided to pursue my passion for programming and technical work.  I enrolled in the Georgia Tech Full-Stack Web Development Program, and so far I am loving it!  I am hoping to make this the next and final step in my career, and am looking forward to many years in this line of work, as a software developer or web developer!
